# dot-files

Author: Icko Iben  

These are my dot-files for various CLI's and macOS applications. Each 
application has its own directory in which its dot-files are stored. 
In the base dot-file directory, I have a script that creates sym-links 
to link each dot-file to the location that its application expects it 
to be.

This what our sym-links should look like

```
~
|_ .config/
|   |_ bash@/
|   |_ kitty@/
|   |_ zsh@/
|   |_ nvim@/
|_ .vim/
|   |_ config@/
|   |_ .colors@/
|_ .vscode@/
|_ .bash_profile@
|_ .bashrc@
|_ .hushlogin@
|_ .tmux.conf@
|_ .vimrc@
|_ .zshenv@
```
