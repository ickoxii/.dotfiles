# dot-files

Author: Icko Iben  

These are my dot-files for various CLI's and macOS applications. Each 
application has its own directory in which its dot-files are stored. 
In the base dot-file directory, I have a script that creates sym-links 
to link each dot-file to the location that its application expects it 
to be.

***The script to sym-link everything has since been deprecated***
