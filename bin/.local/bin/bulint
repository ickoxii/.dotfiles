# Usage: bulint [files]
#
# Linter for latex files uploaded to Baylor's upload site.
#
# This script curls a list of packages used by the Baylor upload site.
# Packages in local .tex files can be matched against this list to
# verify compatibility with the upload site.
#
# Users can either call the script as is `bulint`, in which case
# this script will attempt to read all files in the current directory
# ending in '.tex'. Users can also pass in paths to files, either
# relative or absolute, to verify.
#
# Examples:
#   ./bulint
#   ./bulint hw1.tex ~/classes/hw2.tex ../hw7.tex
#   ./bulint /usr/home/classes/anotherclass/hw3.tex
#
# Note:
#   You can save this script to a location on your path, in which
#   case you can call it without the './' prefix.
