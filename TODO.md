    - .zshrc

## Bugs

1. Various unintended auto-indent behavior caused by configurations in .vimrc

## Improvements

1. Find out how to customize neofetch image
    - source .txt
    - source .png

## Misc

1. configure spotifyd. needed to download the following packages through brew:
    - dbus
    - pkg-config
    - portaudio
    - pass

2. `pass`
pass is a command line password manager. I may be able to use it to
pass passwords through the spotifyd config file so I do not have to
store my username or password in plain text.

3. Make sure spotify-tui is able to use spotifyd as a device
